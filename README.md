# 👁️ Smart Blind Stick for Visually Impaired

This project is an IoT-based smart blind stick designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their environment safely. The system integrates multiple sensors and image recognition-Object recognition capabilities using Arduino Uno and ESP32-CAM. Real-time alerts, obstacle classification, and navigational assistance are provided via the Blynk IoT platform.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The smart blind stick detects obstacles such as humans, chairs, benches, vehicles, rods, and stones. It classifies them using an image recognition model and sends timely alerts and feedback to the user through vibration, sound, and smartphone notifications. The system is compact, portable, and designed to be user-friendly for day-to-day mobility support.

## 🧠 System Workflow

1. The ESP32-CAM continuously captures the surroundings.
2. Image recognition identifies the object type (chair, human, vehicle, etc.).
3. Sensors determine obstacle proximity.
4. Feedback is provided through:
   - Vibration motor (left/right direction guidance)
   - Buzzer (audible warning)
   - Audio guidance (e.g., "Obstacle on left, move right")
   - Notification to the Blynk app (object type and position)

## 📲 Blynk IoT App Configuration

1. Download and install the Blynk IoT app from the App Store or Google Play.
2. Create a new project and select “ESP32” as the device.
3. Copy the generated Auth Token sent to your registered email.
4. Add the following widgets to your Blynk dashboard:
   - Label (to display object type and location)
   - LED (for alert indication)
   - Notification or Image Button (for custom alerts)
5. Paste your Auth Token into your ESP32 code.
